First project using git! I have built basic sites with tutorials before but this is the first project off my local computer and with uploads to github. Will be building Google's home page, using a lot of HTML and CSS positioning. 

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)"# google-homepage"
